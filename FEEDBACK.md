As Dan mentioned, the system must strictly enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that user roles—administrators, operators, and analysts—are mutually exclusive and non-overlapping. Each role may only access data and functions relevant to its responsibilities. For example, operators may only view shipments and routes they are authorized to track and must not access analyst tools or data. RBAC must be implemented and validated at both the login level and server level to prevent any role overlap or data exposure. We control that by each role cannot switch to the other role's dashboard to limit its access.
