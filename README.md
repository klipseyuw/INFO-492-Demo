# 🚛 Logistics Defense AI Platform

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: All commands in this README should be run from the project root directory.

A cutting-edge cybersecurity defense platform for warehouse logistics operations, utilizing AI-powered anomaly detection to identify route manipulation, data tampering, and cyber-physical disruptions in real-time.

## 🏗️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Next.js serverless API routes (`app/api/*`)
- **Database**: SQLite for dev (see `prisma/schema.prisma`) — can swap to Postgres via `DATABASE_URL` in prod
- **ORM**: Prisma Client
- **AI Engine**: OpenRouter API (model: `z-ai/glm-4.5-air:free`) with robust local fallback simulation
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ with Turbopack for fast development
- **Deployment**: Vercel (recommended) / Docker compatible

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** installed ([Download here](https://nodejs.org/))
- **Git** installed for version control
- **Terminal/Command Prompt** access
- **OpenRouter API account** (free tier available)
- **PostgreSQL database** (optional - Prisma dev database included)

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Navigate to Project Directory

```bash
# CRITICAL: All commands must be run from the project root directory
# (already in correct directory if you cloned the project)
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Database Configuration

**Option A: Use Built-in Prisma Database (Recommended)**
```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# The database is pre-configured in .env with a working Prisma dev database
```

**Option B: Use Your Own PostgreSQL Database**
```bash
# 1. Update the DATABASE_URL in .env file with your connection string
# 2. Run migration to create tables
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# 3. Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```


### Step 4: Configure OpenRouter API

The `.env` file already contains a working OpenRouter API key for testing. For production:

1. **Sign up** at [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/)
2. **Get your API key** from the dashboard
3. **Replace** the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in your `.env` file

```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-your-api-key-here"
```

### Step 5: Start Development Server

```bash
# Must be run from project root directory
npm run dev
```

🎉 **Success!** Navigate to **http://localhost:3000/dashboard**

## 🛡️ Platform Features

## 👥 Class Feedback (Mid-Quarter)

- **RBAC rigor for agents:** Ensure roles strictly separate what agents can see/do; test for overlap/leakage and enforce on the server.
- **Realism in data:** Use noisier, real-world routing/telemetry and schedule changes to validate anomaly detection under real conditions.
- **Resilience under load/DoS:** Stress-test the agent path (queueing, rate limits, backpressure, circuit breakers) to degrade safely and recover.
- **Breach playbook:** Define incident response (detect → contain → communicate → recover) and make it role-gated/auditable.
- **Value model nuance:** Don’t rely on dollar value alone—prioritize essentials (e.g., food, critical meds) with context-aware weighting.
- **Reduce rater fatigue:** Shift from manual ratings to backend RL and synthetic data from flagged cases to keep learning without user burnout.
- **Integration risk:** Validate that the four key improvements work together end-to-end, not just in isolation.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Threat Detection
- **Real-time Analysis**: `/api/ai` evaluates shipment timing and attack simulations, logs all analysis steps with `[AI]` prefix
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Human-in-the-loop feedback system using few-shot learning; rate alert accuracy via `AlertFeedbackModal`, and the AI learns from corrections in future predictions
- **Fallback Resilience**: If OpenRouter fails or keys are missing, local simulation produces a compact, structured result (`source: 'fallback'`, `max_tokens ≈ 200`, `temperature: 0.4`)
- **Risk Scoring**: 0–100; alerts are persisted only when `riskScore > 20` (Severity: >70 High, >40 Medium, else Low)
- **Safety First**: Defense agent is **OFF by default** and must be explicitly enabled (never auto-enabled; checked before every AI call)
- **Defensive Parsing**: Robust JSON extraction from AI responses; strips code fences, extracts first object, try/catch fallback
- **Token Efficient**: Prompts are compact and only invoked when agent is active
- **Activity Logging**: Analysis and threat events recorded in memory/`AgentActivity` pattern for status dashboards; extendable with new `type` values

### 🎛️ Intelligent Control Center
- **One-Click Toggle**: Enable/disable AI monitoring instantly (see `AgentToggle`)
- **Persistent State**: Agent status saved to database across sessions; always OFF by default
- **Visual Indicators**: Real-time status with color-coded feedback (see `AgentStatusMonitor`)
- **User Management**: Individual agent control per user account

### 📊 Live Operations Dashboard
- **Route Tracking**: Active shipments with computed delay badges
- **Adaptive Polling**: All live panels (e.g. `ShipmentTable`, `AlertFeed`, `AgentStatusMonitor`) adjust polling interval based on tab visibility; keep cadence consistent for new panels
- **Manual Refresh**: Every panel has a Refresh button for instant updates
- **Delay Detection**: Delay minutes derived client-side; color-coded status chips
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind layout suitable for desktop + mobile

### 🚨 Advanced Alert System
- **Creation Logic**: Alert is persisted only when AI (or fallback) returns `riskScore > 20` (never below)
- **Severity Mapping**: High (>70), Medium (>40), Low (≤40) — keep thresholds consistent across code, UI, and tests
- **Structured Data**: `Alert` model stores shipment routeId reference + description
- **Dismissible**: `/api/alerts` DELETE supports removal; UI updates in place
- **Analysis Reports**: `/api/analysis-report` generates rich post-incident report (explanations, recommendations, compliance list) consumed by `AnalysisReport` component
- **Feedback System**: Click "🎯 Rate Accuracy" on any alert to provide feedback; rate risk score accuracy and attack type correctness to train the AI

### 🔮 Predictive Scheduling Defense
- **Delay Prediction**: `/api/schedule-predict` uses linear regression and moving averages to forecast delivery delays
- **Deviation Detection**: Compares actual vs predicted delays and triggers alerts when deviation exceeds threshold
- **Real-time Analysis**: Updates predictions based on historical shipment data and current route conditions
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels (high/medium/low) based on available data points
- **Predictive Alerts**: New "Predictive Warning" alert type with purple styling and 🔮 icon

### 🎯 Reinforcement Learning System

The AI agent learns from human feedback using **few-shot learning** (no custom model training required):

#### How It Works:
1. **AI makes a prediction**: Analyzes a shipment and assigns risk score + attack type
2. **You provide feedback**: Click "🎯 Rate Accuracy" on any alert
   - Was the risk score appropriate? (Yes/No)
   - Was the attack type correct? (Yes/No)
   - Provide corrections if needed (actual risk score 0-100, actual attack type)
   - Add optional notes for context
3. **AI learns immediately**: Next analysis includes recent accurate feedback examples in the prompt
4. **Continuous improvement**: The more feedback you provide, the more accurate future predictions become

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Few-Shot Learning**: No model fine-tuning needed; feedback examples are injected into prompts
- **Stored in Database**: `AlertFeedback` model stores corrections with original AI predictions
- **Automatic Enrichment**: `/api/ai` fetches 5 most recent accurate feedback examples before each analysis
- **Free & Effective**: Works with any OpenRouter model without additional costs

#### Best Practices:
- Rate alerts immediately after simulations for best learning
- Provide detailed notes explaining why predictions were wrong
- Focus on correcting high-severity alerts first
- Review learning examples in database via Prisma Studio

### 🧪 Integrated Testing & Simulation
Generate realistic operational + adversarial data:

```bash
# Run from project root directory
npm run simulate         # Continuous simulation (60-second intervals)
npm run simulate:single  # Single route test for quick validation
```

## 🧩 Safe Extension Guidelines

- Before any AI call: always validate agent activation and required fields; keep prompts compact
- Never auto-enable the agent; must be toggled explicitly
- If introducing new severity levels, update alert creation, UI badge mapping, and tests
- Avoid long-running loops in API routes; use client polling or external scripts
- Never log secrets; degrade gracefully if keys are missing
- Use `[AI]` log prefixes for notable analysis steps
## 📝 Conventions & Error Handling

- API success: `{ success: true, ... }`; errors: `{ error, message? }` with proper status codes
- Defensive AI JSON parsing: strip code fences, extract first `{...}`, try/catch, then fallback
- Keep responses lean; avoid storing raw prompts/large payloads in DB

## 🧑‍💻 Login & Logout Guide (for All Users)

### 🔐 Demo Accounts (RBAC) — Email + Password

For class demos requiring strict role separation (RBAC), you can enable simple email/password demo accounts. Set these environment variables and use the "Demo Accounts" tab on the login page:

```env
# Optional demo users (mutually exclusive roles)
DEMO_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
DEMO_ADMIN_PASSWORD=adminpass
DEMO_ANALYST_EMAIL=analyst@example.com
DEMO_ANALYST_PASSWORD=analystpass
DEMO_OPERATOR_EMAIL=operator@example.com
DEMO_OPERATOR_PASSWORD=operatorpass
```

Notes:
- Each demo account is permanently mapped to its role (ADMIN, ANALYST, OPERATOR). The server issues a JWT containing this role.
- Server-side RBAC is enforced on protected APIs; page routing enforces role-specific dashboards.
- The passwordless flow below still works in parallel; choose whichever is needed for your demo.

### 🔐 Login

The Logistics Defense AI Platform uses a **passwordless authentication system**, meaning users can log in securely using their **email** or **phone number** — no password required.

**Steps to log in:**

1. Open the platform at **http://localhost:3000/login** (or your deployed URL)
2. Choose **Email Login** or **Phone Login** tab
3. Enter your email address or phone number
4. Click **"Send Verification Code"**
5. Check your email (or console output in development mode) for the 6-digit code
6. Enter the code and click **"Verify & Login"**
7. ✅ You'll be redirected to your personalized **Dashboard**

**Notes:**
- If your email or phone number is not registered, the system will **automatically create a new user account**
- Verification codes are valid for **5 minutes**
- In development mode, verification codes appear in the **server terminal** console
- In production, codes can be sent via **SendGrid** (email) or **Twilio** (SMS) for real delivery
- Rate limit: Maximum **3 code requests per minute** per IP address

**Development Mode Tips:**
- Watch the terminal where `npm run dev` is running
- You'll see output like:
  ```
  🔐 VERIFICATION CODE for test@example.com:
  📧 Code: 123456
  ⏰ Expires: 10/15/2024, 8:30:00 PM
  👤 User ID: clxxx123
  ```
- In development, an alert popup may also display the code

---

### 🚪 Logout

Logging out is simple and secure:

1. Click the **"Logout"** button in the top-right corner of the navigation bar
2. Your authentication session and cookies are immediately cleared on the server
3. You will be redirected to the **Login** page
4. Access to protected pages (like `/dashboard`) will now require re-login

**What happens during logout:**
- JWT session token is invalidated
- `auth_token` cookie is cleared from your browser
- All cached authentication data is removed
- You cannot access protected routes until logging in again

---

### 🔒 Security & Sessions

**Session Duration:**
- JWT tokens expire after **7 days** of inactivity
- Verification codes expire after **5 minutes**

**Protected Routes:**
- `/dashboard` - Requires authentication
- All `/api/*` routes (except `/api/auth/*` and `/api/health`)

**Public Routes:**
- `/login` - Login page (always accessible)
- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication endpoints
- `/api/health` - Health check endpoint

**Session Persistence:**
- Your login session persists across browser tabs and page refreshes
- Sessions survive server restarts (stored in JWT token)
- Close browser to auto-logout (cookie-based)

---

### 🧰 Developer Notes

- **No `.env` configuration needed for end users** — only the server operator needs environment variables
- All login verification and JWT session logic happen on the backend
- New users are automatically created when they first log in with an unregistered email/phone
- User accounts are linked to the AI agent settings (each user has individual `agentActive` state)

**For Server Operators:**

Ensure your `.env` file contains:
```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secure-random-secret-key"
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-openrouter-api-key"
# Optional: demo RBAC login accounts
DEMO_ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@example.com"
DEMO_ADMIN_PASSWORD="adminpass"
DEMO_ANALYST_EMAIL="analyst@example.com"
DEMO_ANALYST_PASSWORD="analystpass"
DEMO_OPERATOR_EMAIL="operator@example.com"
DEMO_OPERATOR_PASSWORD="operatorpass"
```

Generate a secure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`:
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**🚫 "Cannot find module '@/lib/prisma'"**
```bash
# Solution: Regenerate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```

**🚫 "ENOENT: no such file or directory"**  
```bash
# Solution: Ensure you're in the correct directory
# Should already be in project root directory
pwd  # Should show path ending in INFO-492-Demo
```

**🚫 "Database connection failed"**
```bash  
# Solution: Check if database is running
npx prisma db push
# Or reset database
npx prisma migrate reset
```

**🚫 "Port 3000 already in use"**
```bash
# Solution: Kill existing process or use different port
npx kill-port 3000
# Or start on different port
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

**🚫 "OpenRouter API error"**
- Verify API key in `.env`
- If failing, system should still return fallback analysis (`source: fallback`)
- Inspect server logs for `[AI]` prefixed messages

**🚫 "No alerts generating"**
- Confirm agent is ON (Agent Toggle active + Status Monitor shows Active/Idle)
- Verify simulation created shipments (`/api/shipments` response not empty)
- Risk must exceed 20 to persist an alert; inspect AI response JSON
- Fallback path may yield lower scores; retry or run attack simulation

### Reset Everything
```bash
# Complete reset (Windows PowerShell friendly)
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules,.next 2>$null
npm install
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate reset
npm run dev
```

### Get Help
- **Check Logs**: Browser console (F12) and terminal output
- **Database Issues**: Run `npm run db:studio` to inspect data
- **API Issues**: Test endpoints directly with curl or Postman
- **Performance**: Monitor Network tab in browser dev tools
